# Test repo for comparing serverless functions to express server

- Just a wee test API and FE to compare a normal express server to serverless functions on vercel.
- Also test `useSWR` on FE.
- Not using `create-next-app` but probs should be.

TODO:

- Refactor to use NEXT.JS structure (will be one app then)
- Remove immutability helper (stick with lodash)
- Clean up `useSWR` usage as its super messy currently.
- Probs more
